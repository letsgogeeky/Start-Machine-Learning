# Getting started with Machine Learning
A curated list of resources to get started with Machine Learning. It includes courses from MIT OCW, and other free and accessible resources.


__Question:__ Should I start by the mathematics or the applications? 

__Answer:__  Doesn't matter. If you start by applications and APIs, you'll eventually hit the mathematics, and if you start by mathematics you'll eventually want to try out applications. so try to keep a balance between both.


__Question:__ Should I have a degree in Math. or Engineering?

__Answer:__ It depends on what you want to achieve in the field. but let's say the answer of can you get into the fields anyways is always __YES__.

## Courses
- Computational Thinking and Data Science by MIT 
A very good beginning to learn about the ML and what you might expect.

- Artificial Intelligence by MIT
A course for traditional machine learning methods and how things are. Also introduces a set of very important ML methods such as SVM, Neural Nets, and a lot more by Prof. Patrick <3

## What about Mathematics?

- If you’re looking for a good mathematics overview you can watch this.

## Books
 
- The hundred ML book: it’s a free open source book. Only 100 pages. A good start. but you'll read more than this book down the road.

## What if I have zero math background and I still want to start?

- If you don’t have any mathematical background and would like to learn about it from scratch, I would recommend starting with www.khanacademy.org/math (KhanAcademy)
