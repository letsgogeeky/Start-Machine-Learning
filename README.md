# Getting started with Machine Learning using FREE resources
A curated list of resources to get started with Machine Learning. It includes courses from MIT OCW, and other free and accessible resources.

This repo is for available __FREE__ resources that were tried and proven quality and usefulness.


__Question:__ Should I start by the mathematics or the applications? 

__Answer:__  Doesn't matter. If you start by applications and APIs, you'll eventually hit the mathematics, and if you start by mathematics you'll eventually want to try out applications. so try to keep a balance between both.


__Question:__ Should I have a degree in Math. or Engineering?

__Answer:__ It depends on what you want to achieve in the field. but let's say the answer of can you get into the fields anyways is always __YES__.

## Courses
- Computational Thinking and Data Science by MIT: A very good beginning to learn about the ML and what you might expect. [Course Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1lhuz6pZC0&list=PLUl4u3cNGP619EG1wp0kT-7rDE_Az5TNd)

- Artificial Intelligence by MIT: A course for traditional machine learning methods and how things are. Also introduces a set of very important ML methods such as SVM, Neural Nets, and a lot more by Prof. Patrick <3 [Course Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjZBTDzGeGg&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63gFHB6xb-kVBiQHYe_4hSi)

- Practical machine learning course by freeCodeCamp <3 (10 hours) [One video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwIo3gDZCVQ)

- Introduction to Deep Learning using Tensorflow: You’ll learn about Image classification using convolutional neural nets [Free course on Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-tensorflow-for-deep-learning--ud187)


## What about Mathematics?

- If you’re looking for a good mathematics overview you can watch this. [Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3TpdPmTLso&t=10522s)


## Books
 
- The hundred ML book: it’s a free open source book. Only 100 pages. A good start. but you'll read more than this book down the road. [The Hundred Pages ML Book](http://themlbook.com/wiki/doku.php)


## What if I have zero mathematics background and I still want to start?

- If you don’t have any mathematical background and would like to learn about it from scratch, I would recommend starting with www.khanacademy.org/math (KhanAcademy)
